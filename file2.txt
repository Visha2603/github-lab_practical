GitHub branching allows developers to create separate lines of development within a repository.
A branch lets you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Multiple branches make team collaboration easier and safer.
Changes from a branch can be merged back into the main branch after testing.
Branching helps maintain code stability while enabling continuous development.
